# Pastel97
A series of Redmond97-based themes for XFCE4. 

Intended to eventually be used as the aesthetic basis of "[9xOS](https://github.com/faithvoid/9xos)", a retro PC gaming OS for the Raspberry Pi, but works for all *nix distros as long as they can run XFCE4!

### Installation:
Copy your theme of choice to the ".themes" folder in your local user directory (if the directory does not exist, make it and then move the theme into it!)
